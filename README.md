### 1. Datacamp Courses
Below is a screenshot of the mandatory courses I had to follow for this
minor, as you can see almost all of them I completed after the due date
was met. I usually completed them in the week after the due date. This was
probably caused by delay I received in the first week of the minor, hence
the 1 week divergency. Obviously this is not the right way to deal with
delay, but due to the work pressure of the minor besides the Datacamp
courses it ended up being this way.

On the side I also did the first 2 chapters of the course Introduction to
Deep Learning with Pytorch, which is a course that was advised by one of
our teachers to help getting familiar with Neural Networks.
